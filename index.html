    <h3>About Me</h3>
<p id="about-me">I am passionate about my aspirations to be a full stack web developer that is proficient in creating and designing. I have worked with HTML, CSS, and Javascript for over 4 years. I have always found technology fascinating since I was 5 yeard old and the curiosity of how technology functions is the sole root of my career ambitions. I've stumbled upon web development since highschool and always kept a keen interest in it since. Now it is my goal to further my development skillsets and indulge in a career where I can help build creations that will benefit the world.</p>
